Hello, my name is Ariana, and I am in the BSMS program for Computer Science. I will be getting my first Bachelors in spring of next year. I am from Queens, New York and moved upstate to study. I am interested in Robotics programming. I am new to using GitHub and am looking forward to learning about Software Engineering alongside fellow capable students. I am greatful for any patience given by my peers. This is my first commit!
